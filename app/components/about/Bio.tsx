                ðŸ’¼ As a web developer, I have experience in both front-end and
                back-end development, where I focus on creating engaging user
                experiences. I enjoy using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS for
                the front-end, along with other tools. On the back-end, I work
                with PostgreSQL and Node.js to build strong API servers. I
                handle tasks like authentication, authorization, and explore
                different databases like MongoDB.{" "}

                ðŸŒŸ Started learning a couple of years ago, and yes, it was tough
                at first! But CS50 opened my eyes to the exciting world of
                computer science, and I fell in love with coding and
                problem-solving.

                the ReCoder bootcamp, refining my skills and deepening my
                understanding of software development & I've gained invaluable
                experience in collaborating with my team and our exceptional
                trainers.

                ðŸ›¸ Sci-fi movies are my jam! They spark my imagination and drive
                me to explore new things. I'm all about building my own stuff,
                dreaming of the day when the kind of tech we see in those movies
                becomes real.
